setup
git clone git@github.com:s3341458/mydocker.git
cd mydocker
go build .

sample one:
sudo ./mydocker run -ti -image busybox -command /bin/sh

test network
sudo ./mydocker network create --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --driver bridge testbridge
sudo ./mydocker run -ti -p 80:80 --net testbridge -image busybox -command /bin/sh

you can also get help by command ./mydocker -h

All commands are defined in main_command.go, since this is a such simple project
it is not difficult for experienced programmer to figure out how to use it.

since this project is for me to play with, so no much documentions of how to play
with it. If anyone want to know more details feel free to email me through
